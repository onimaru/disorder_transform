A Directed Graph is nothing more than a set of nodes and arrows. Nodes represent variables and arrows represent relationship between such variables. Directed Graphs can be used in similar way as Counter Factuals in order to represent causal relationship. When a graph has the meaning of a probability distributions it is usally called a Bayesian Network, although not everyone likes this terminology.

## Conditional Independence

Let us first define conditional independence before moving on.

**Definition**: Let X, Y and Z be random variables. X and Y are conditionally independent gizen Z, $$X \Perp Y \vert Z$$.
