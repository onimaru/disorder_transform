I am a physicist with a PhD in Materials Science and Engineering. I was a Professor for five years teaching Theoretical Physics, Calculus, Programming and Experimental Physics for Engineering undergraduates courses. After that a worked as a Post-Doc in the areas of General Relativity and Quantum Gravity. However, today I proudly work as a data scientist.

The goals of this blog involves publishing some material for the curious ones, to focus on a side project, to write about my thoughts and to have some time to write in english. I donâ€™t even know if I will share this with someone.

Besides my background as an experimental physicist, in the last three years I have been teaching and studying mainly theoretical topics in mathematical physics. With most of my free time dedicated to get deeper understanding of the mathematical tools needed to a theoretical physicist, my fields of interest have changed.

Data Science fields of Interest:

- Generative Adversarial Nets
- Explainable Machine learning
- Recommender Systems

Mathematics and Physics fields of Interest:

- General Relativity
- Quantum Field Theory
- Mathematical formalism of curved space-time
- Dynamical systems
- Stochastic dynamical systems
- Chaotic dynamical systems

It follows some courses I have been teaching:
- Classical Mechanics
- Thermodynamics
- Waves and oscilations
- Fluid mechanics
- Electromagnetism
- Experimental physics
- Multivariable calculus
- Vectorial calculus
- Ordinary differential equations
- Partial differential equations
- Complex calculus
- Taylor series
- Fourier series and Fourier Transform
- Error analysis on experimental science
- Mechanical Vibrations
- Operations Research

Extension courses (free courses offered by the university) on the format of Mathematical Physics Club:
- Computational physics
- Introduction to Python programming language
- Quantum mechanics
- Special Relativity
